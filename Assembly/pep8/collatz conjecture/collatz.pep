; Firstly, this program asks the user for a positive integer.
; Then it checks if the input is equal to 1.
; If the input is equal to 1, the program terminates.
; If not, it checks if it is odd or even by calculating the input modulo 2.
; If the input is even, it divides it by two. If it is odd, it multiplies it by 3 and then adds 1.
; The program will keep checking and processing the input until the result is 1.
