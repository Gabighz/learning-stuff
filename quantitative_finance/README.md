I use the [OpenBB Terminal](https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/OpenBBTerminal) for analysis.

These scripts are mainly for my own personal learning by practice. 

But they prove useful for things simple enough that I don't need to load up the Terminal. Or for things that are not supported by it yet (e.g. [InteractiveBrokers API access](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=5041)).
