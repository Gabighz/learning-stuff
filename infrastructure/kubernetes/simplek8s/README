# Simple kubernetes cluster

If running locally, on MacOS, and got minikube all good, kubectl would first need:
    minikube start --driver=hyperkit

Can start it up with:
    kubectl apply -f client-pod.yaml
    kubectl apply -f client-node-port.yaml

Can be checked with:
    kubectl get pods
    kubectl get services
    kubectl get deployments

Remove an object:
    kubectl delete -f <config-file>

Get detailed info about an object:
    kubectl describe <object type> <object name>
such as
    kubectl describe pod client-pod

Can visit the node in your browser by pasting the output of:
    minikube ip

in the address bar and add :31515 at the end of the ip address.

## Object Types in k8s:
- Pods = Runs one or more closely related containers
    - Good for one-off dev purposes; rarely used in production (because of limitations like updating config)
- Services = Sets up networking in a k8s cluster
- Deployment = Maintains a set of identical pods, ensuring they have the correct config and that the right number exists
    - Good for dev and for production
