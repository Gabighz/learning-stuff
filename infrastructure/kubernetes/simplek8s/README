# Simple kubernetes cluster

If running locally, on MacOS, and got minikube all good, kubectl would first need:
    minikube start --driver=hyperkit

Can start it up with:
    kubectl apply -f client-pod.yaml
    kubectl apply -f client-node-port.yaml

Can be checked with:
    kubectl get pods
    kubectl get services

Can visit the node in your browser by pasting the output of:
    minikube ip

in the address bar and add :31515 at the end of the ip address.
